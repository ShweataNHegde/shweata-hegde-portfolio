Let‚Äôs learn!\nLeafcutter ants can strip almost 17% of the leaf biomass from plants, but they don‚Äôt eat the leaves that they cut. Instead, they clean and convert leaves into manure, using it as fertilizer to grow their crop: fungus! The fungus (L. gongylophorus) then consumes the leaf and forms fruiting bodies on which the ants feast.\nJust like weeds in farms compete for food and space, these fungi cultivated by the leafcutter ants are also vulnerable to antagonists\u0026rsquo; attacks, which typically comes from competing fungi, Escovopsis. But these ants have their version of pesticides - antifungals!\nApart from secreting the antifungals, the ants also have a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with bacteria on their body. These bacteria also produce antifungals to keep out the antagonist Escovopsis.\nGiven that the battle has been going on for millions of years, Escovopsis has developed resistance. But the ants have countered too, and the bacterial symbionts provide flexibility. They can mix-n-match their genes easily, making it easier to produce a slightly different cocktail of antifungals. Bacteria reproduce faster than ants, making it easier to come up with antifungals to combat a new version of Escovopsis. Indirectly, the bacterial symbionts protect the fungal monoculture (L. gongylophorus) of the colony.\nThis ever-evolving chemical battle might hold answers to solving the antimicrobial resistance problem humans will have to tackle shortly since a growing number of pathogens are becoming resistant to antimicrobials. Researchers can study the coevolution between the bacterial symbiont and antagonist fungi, to get insights into developing new antimicrobials!\nEdits: Subhashini Muralidharan, Awanti Sambarey\nPicture: Alejandro Soffia, Flickr\n","date":"20 March 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/2022-03-20-leaf-cutter-ants/","section":"Science Articles","summary":"","title":"Relationship triad -- Antimicrobial lessons from ants, fungi \u0026 bacteria üêúü¶†üçÉ","type":"articles"},{"content":"Although I call myself a science podcaster, writing is my first love.

If you encounter the actual threat, your immune system remembers it and fights back. Recently, we‚Äôve developed vaccines using genetic information to get your own body to produce the impostor and attack it.\nAlthough we developed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in record time, vaccine manufacturing is a complex process. It involves culturing chicken eggs or other cells, such as yeast and human cells, in large bioreactors with careful filtering processes to produce the impostors ‚Äì an expensive task often limited to wealthy countries. COVID vaccines must also be stored cold, another challenge for global distribution.\nInstead of relying on animal cells, we can use plants to produce pathogen impostors ‚Äì the virus-like particles. Researchers have now used engineered bacteria and plant viruses to insert the genetic info responsible for producing these impostors into leaves of mature plants like tobacco. The leaves take up the genetic information and make loads of impostors that we can harvest and purify.\nOne such plant-based vaccine for COVID-19 produced by the Medicago company is now in human testing. Other vaccines, like those for influenza, are at earlier stages of development.\nEven though we would still have to store the purified impostor at low temperatures (2-8 C), researchers are developing vaccines in the form of powdered leaves (e.g. lettuce) that have already produced virus-like particles! They can be stored at room temperature and easily transported. By using greenhouses instead of fancy bioreactors, plant-based vaccines are an affordable alternative for countries with limited manufacturing resources.

This web connects all the devices (read trees!) \u0026amp; is used for communication. Of course, we are talking about WWW ‚Äî not the World Wide Web but the Wood Wide Web!\nResearchers have long known that certain fungi form associations with the roots of the trees. They help in fixing nitrogen, and in return, the trees give them food. That is all the exchange that happens or so we thought until Dr. Suzzane Simard, a passionate forest researcher, came along.\nIn 1997, she uncovered that the connection between fungi and trees was not a one-to-one relationship. Instead, each fungus associates with many trees and a tree root can associate with different species of fungi! This interlinkage, or the fungal-root network, creates channels for trees to exchange nutrition \u0026amp; information between different individuals.\nOlder trees transfer food to younger ones to help them survive. Dying trees give up their stored food to the ones thriving. Using this linkage, an affected tree can also ‚Äúinform‚Äù its neighbor about an ongoing threat. But just like any other community, there are bad players too. A tree or a plant from a different species might ‚Äúhack‚Äù the system \u0026amp; ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù some food that was going elsewhere.\nThough technological advances have helped us map \u0026amp; understand these underground networks in forests, unknowns remain. The vastness \u0026amp; complexity of the network make it harder for researchers to study them in their entirety \u0026amp; understand the nutrition and information transfer mechanisms.\nUnfortunately, deforestation is disrupting these vital networks. Restoration efforts often focus on re-growing single tree species in isolation, neglecting the restoration of the underground networks, which leads to poorly developed forests.\nSo the next time you see trees, appreciate the myriads of underground fungal-root networks that connect them.

Trees, it turns out, have their own version of Morse code, and they are tree rings!\nCounting tree rings will tell you its age. But there is a lot more to it! The rings can tell us the climate story of the past long before measurements were recorded!\nLet‚Äôs track back and understand how tree rings are formed. Firstly, not all trees have tree rings. The ones growing in temperate or even trophic regions respond to the seasonality by forming variable rings. Trees form larger rings in favourable conditions like spring or wet conditions - characterized by a light shade of wood - known as Earlywood. At the same time, they grow a smaller ring in the autumn or dry season, which are darker and compact, known as Latewood. Earlywood and Latewood form a year‚Äôs tree ring.\nIf there was a drought one summer, the ring grows narrower. If there was a wildfire, we see that in its rings. This is how numerous tree species, some living for thousands of years, encode the climate in their rings as they age. Across thousands of trees, researchers can pattern match and cross-date, reference, and analyze the rings to paint an accurate picture of the past.\nIf you‚Äôre wondering if researchers go around stumping trees- worry not! They use an instrument called a Hollow Borer to carefully take out a chunk of wood from the tree stem to analyze its rings. What you should be concerned about is what researchers have decrypted about the past climate. In almost all kinds of trees sensitive to temperature, we find evidence of unprecedented global warming caused by humans.\nThese trees will continue to add rings, encrypting the status of the climate, one year at a time. But by the actions we take, humans have the power to determine the kinds of rings they will form in the future!\nOn a less serious note, tree rings have spilt secrets about archaeology, geography, and so much more!\nEdits: Nivedita Hegdekar\n","date":"26 May 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/2021-05-26-tree-rings/","section":"Science Articles","summary":"Trees have their own version of Morse code, and they are tree rings!","title":"Tree Rings -- Morse Code Of Life","type":"articles"},{"content":"Can infecting mosquitoes with a specific bacteria save humanity from a debilitating viral disease?\nDengue, a hugely neglected disease that plagues 400 millions people each year, is spread through the bite of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. The mosquito becomes a carrier when she takes the blood of a person infected with the virus.\nWith no antiviral therapies or vaccines, the only way of controlling the disease is by killing the mosquitoes and preventing breeding. What else can we do to reduce transmission?\nThat‚Äôs where Wolbachia, a bacteria present in 60% of all insects (but not naturally in Aedes mosquito), comes into the picture. Surprisingly, when researchers infected the mosquito egg with Wolbachia, it altered the adult hosts‚Äô workings and prevented the viral replication cycle upon infection.\nBut transmission reduction is effective only if the majority mosquito population has Wolbachia. How can we achieve that?\nThe bacteria has several tricks up its sleeve! When Wolbachia-infected females mate with either Wolbachia infected or uninfected male, their children have Wolbachia in their cells. However, when uninfected females mate with the infected male, the egg never hatches. This manipulative trick is known as cytoplasmic incompatibility. By introducing lots of infected mosquitoes into an area and letting them reproduce over several generations, nearly all will have Wolbachia.\nTrials in Indonesia, headed by World Mosquito Program, show 77% disease reduction in areas where the researchers released the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes compared to a similar area where they didn‚Äôt. Wolbachia, once introduced in the population, will remain in the population, making it a self-sustainable approach. Independent studies have shown that Wolbachia carrying mosquitoes are no threat to humans or the environment.\nDue to decades of research and worldwide testing, we can also translate this method to other diseases that mosquitoes transmit, like Zika and Malaria. The story of the Wolbachia method feels like a breath of fresh air in a suffocating world crippled by the ongoing pandemic.\nEdits: Nivedita\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n","date":"14 April 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/2021-04-14-wolbachia-infected-mosquitoes/","section":"Science Articles","summary":"","title":"Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to save humantiy from dengue","type":"articles"},{"content":"","date":"21 March 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/book-review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Book-Review","type":"tags"},{"content":"Who are you?

Recently, microbes have gotten ‚Äòpositive‚Äô attention with the advent of probiotics. Ed Yong explains that microbes are neither protagonists nor antagonists in our story. Relationships between us \u0026amp; microbes are complex - we cannot make sense of life while looking at either of them as isolates or without fully understanding such relationships.\nThe book will make us rethink our understanding of life.

Literally, every molecule of the cell is either made by ribosomes or by enzymes which are themselves made by ribosomes.\nFrom a false start in physics to stumbling into the ‚Äòunfashionable\u0026rsquo; ribosome; from not knowing how to hold a pipette at his second stint in grad school to sharing the Nobel prize with his rivals (Yonath and Steitz), from being rejected for 50 faculty positions to becoming the President of the Royal Society ‚Äì the author shares an honest, insecure, personal, and humbling account of being in academia.\nHis writing throws light on the complex interplay between competition \u0026amp; collaboration in science; the fuzzy line between the two, the messiness, politics and pitfalls of science, the sometimes-toxic scientific culture \u0026amp; dynamics.

One such intricate beauty comes in the form of microscopic diatoms, the photosynthetic alga found in all water forms. With an estimated 100,000 known species, they are the most diverse and visually stunning forms of eukaryotes.\nTheir outer shells known as ‚Äúfrustules‚Äù sets them apart. The frustules, made of inorganic silica (aka glass), have beautiful species-specific nanopatterns. First descriptions of diatoms date back to 1700s ‚Äì they intrigued early microscopists peering through their lenses, because of their geometry and ornamentation.\nThen came the microscopists of the Victorian era, who turned their slides into canvas, and arranged these beautiful little ones into miniature mandalas, perfectly blending art and science. The earliest of the diatom arrangements date back to the 1800s, reaching its peak in the latter part of the 19th century. Though the art was sought by many naturalists, it slowly died off along with its microscopists.\nKlaus Kemp, a self-taught diatom artist, has now brought back life to this beautiful art form. He was 16 when he first saw the diatom arrangement of the Victorian era. The art begins with collecting, prepping and cleaning the diatoms. The artist then meticulously, for hours or days, arranges individual cells with a hair or needle into beautiful designs.\nContemplating life‚Äôs beauty, Charles Darwin once said, ‚ÄúFew objects are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of diatoms: were they only created to be admired under the microscope?‚Äù But thanks to advanced technology and tools (cameras!), you don‚Äôt need to own a microscope to admire the beauty of these symmetrical beauties!\nDiatoms are estimated to contribute 20% of the oxygen that we breathe.

But can animals do the same?\nSome animals, including corals, some species of sea anemones, and worms, can photosynthesize by forming a relationship with photosynthetic algae, in a process known as endosymbiosis. Often, these animals are dependent on the endosymbionts for their food requirements.\nInterestingly, Leaf Sheep and Elysia - types of sea slugs - have taken it a notch further. Why make chloroplasts when you can steal them? Instead of hosting the whole algae in their bodies, they strip the chloroplast from the algal food and line their digestive tracts with it, by a phenomenon known as kleptoplasty. In case of unavailability of food, these translucent solar-powered slugs bask in the sun and let the chloroplasts work. Researchers estimate that some species can keep the chloroplasts active in their tracts for several months.\nAlthough it sounds fascinating, the art of stealing chloroplasts is harder than you think! These sea slugs have to strip off just the chloroplast from their algal food and also retain them as functional for a longer duration. Additionally, they have to protect them from their body‚Äôs own defense mechanism. Most importantly, these slugs must possess algal genes in their cellular nuclei, necessary to sustain the chloroplasts. The slugs also need to biochemically modify these chloroplasts to reduce the harm caused by reactive species produced in the process of photosynthesis.\nMany details about this phenomenon are controversial, and the underpinnings of the mechanism are relatively unknown. Difficulty in finding these animals only makes it harder. Chloroplasts are thought to be a cyanobacterium which formed a permanent relationship with a eukaryote, billions of years ago. Understandings about the solar-powered slugs might provide insights into how photosynthetic algae evolved and much more.\nUntil researchers unveil the mysteries of these curious little ones, let‚Äôs not forget to marvel at the beauties of nature.\nEdits: Manasi Agrawal\nImage: Karen N.

But did you know that there is a major flaw at the heart of photosynthesis?\nThis has to do with the key enzyme that goes by the mouthful name, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, which sits scattered in the chloroplast of cells in most plants (1st image). Involved in the fixation of inorganic carbon to organic carbon, RuBisCO, is literally at the crossroads of life. However, it is lazy and inefficient at its job. Instead of fixing only CO2, it uses oxygen about 25% of the time. This mainly because RubisCO evolved in a nearly oxygen free atmosphere, a few billion years ago.\nThe oxygenated product is toxic and the plant needs to invest energy to recycle it. To compensate for the loss of photosynthetic efficiency, most plants produce RuBisCO in large quantities, making it one of the most abundant enzymes in the biosphere. The inefficiency of RuBisCO is one of the limiting factors of photosynthesis.\nInterestingly, some bacteria, algae and hornworts have developed a Carbon-Concentrating Mechanism (CCM) to get around this problem. Unlike plants, Chlamydomonas and other photosynthetic green algae concentrate RuBisCO into a compartment called pyrenoid inside the chloroplasts. They employ carbon transporters and carbon leakage preventers to enhance the CO2 concentration, up to 50 folds, in the pyrenoid. This way RuBisCO fixes only CO2, and by proxy, the photosynthetic efficiency goes up.\nA lot of research has gone into better understanding the CCM, in the hopes of introducing it into higher plants. Enhancing photosynthesis is seen to be one of the ways to improve food security in world moving towards a population boom. Successful introduction of CCM into crop plants would also mean more people having sufficient food on their plates and will ensure sustainability.\nEdits: Nivedita Hegdekar, Ananya Mukherjee\nImage credits: David S.

Ever wondered what\u0026rsquo;s responsible for this smell?\nStreptomyces, one of the most abundant bacteria in soil and some plants, produce a volatile compound called geosmin. When the raindrop hits the ground, tiny bubbles are produced at the point of contact with the soil. These bubbles rise up encapsulating bacterial compounds like geosmin and burst into aerosols. When the wind blows, these geosmin laden aerosols reach your nose. Some animals including humans are extremely sensitive to geosmin and can sense it when present in trace quantities.\nBut, why do these bacteria produce geosmin? To give humans a sense of joy during rains? No, there is more to it. A recent study shows that Springtails, wingless arthropods, are attracted to geosmin produced by sporulating colonies of Streptomyces. Springtails, in turn, feed on the Streptomyces and spread the bacterial spores through their faeces. The spores sometimes also hitch-hike on the hydrophobic surface of Springtails. Therefore, Springtails act as vectors of Streptomyces spore dispersion.\nThough geosmin is a chemoattractant produced for dispersal of Streptomyces spores, its warm smell also disperses joy during rains!\nImage credit: Flickr Creative commons (Santosh Kumar, Katja Schulz), Wikimedia Commons Edited by: Surabhi Sonam\n","date":"13 November 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/2020-11-13-petrichor/","section":"Science Articles","summary":"","title":"Petrichor!","type":"articles"},{"content":" At first glance you might see only a bunch of flowers. But on closer inspection, you can spot a gorgeous white insect disguised as a flower. With its pinkish-white body and petal-like legs, female Orchid Mantises resemble a beautiful blossom. Hymenopus coronatus are mainly found in the forests of Southeast Asia.\nUnlike chameleons, which camouflage to fend off predators, orchid mantises mimic flowers to be a better predator. They sit still and wait for a pollinator to approach. When it\u0026rsquo;s close, they use their front legs to quickly grab the prey and feast on it.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not all there is to it. Researchers have recently discovered that orchid mantises mimic a flower not to blend in, but to stand out. They don\u0026rsquo;t always need to sit on a flower, but can attract pollinators at rates similar to (or sometimes better than) real flowers. From an insect\u0026rsquo;s perspective, mantises look bigger and brighter than the surrounding flowers. This phenomenon, where the mantises tap into the sensory biases of their prey, is known as aggressive mimicry.\nDespite what the name implies, mantises don\u0026rsquo;t mimic an orchid.
