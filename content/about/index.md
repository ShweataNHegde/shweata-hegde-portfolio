Welcome! I am Shweata, presently a Young India Fellow at Ashoka University. I also love talking about science. I am what people call a science communicator. Over the years, I have led many projects including IndiaAsksWhy, #semanticClimate, Demystifying Rare Genetic Diseases, and Pralay. This website is a work-in-progres curating all my work in one place :)
