At the Young India Fellowship, me and three other Fellows developed a board game called Pralay.

Imagine a world facing the consequences of climate change. Let us assume that in India, extreme heat waves are causing outdoor workers to collapse. The government could advocate for a policy to ban work during peak hours. However, this would lead to significant financial losses and project delays. Now, picture yourself as an electoral candidate in a decision-making position. What would your strategy focus on: the wellbeing of workers or the economic welfare of your state?  

We developed a climate-based, strategy 3-6 player board game called Pralay, where players navigate climate scenarios like the one described above and take decisions as part of a presidential race to secure the votes of global citizens. As developers, we aim to engage players with the nuanced science and politics of climate change.
