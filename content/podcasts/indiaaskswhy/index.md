IndiaAsksWhy is a science podcast featuring two curious high schoolers---Utsuka and Jigyasa. Join them as they explore curious science questions. How many of us have asked a question in classrooms only to not have it answered because it was not important for exams? Born as an anti-thesis for an education system overdependent on rote memorisation, the podcast explores curious science questions asked by high school students. We have produced 16 podcast episodes and hosted scientist interactions at schools, reaching a cumulative of over 10,000 students. The podcast was funded by IndiaBioscience Outreach Grants.
