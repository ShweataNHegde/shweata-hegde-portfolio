Since 2021, I have been obsessed with podcasting as a medium for science communication. There is something so special about using audio, sound effects to tell stories :) Over the years, I have worked on several science podcasts:
1. IndiaAsksWhy (co-founder)
2. Beyond The Bench (co-producer)
3. Demystifying Rare Genetic Diseases (co-producer)
