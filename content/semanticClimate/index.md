What started as a 3-month internship has turned into an almost 5-year commitment with #semanticClimate.Over the years, I have grown from being an outreach intern, a programme manager to a developer. I have also had the pleasure of hosting and being part of various events, including UN Datathon (at the United Nations, Geneva) and Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathons (Delhi).
