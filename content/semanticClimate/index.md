title: My work at semanticClimate

What started as a 3-month internship has turned into an almost 5-year commitment with [#semanticClimate](https://semanticclimate.github.io/p/en/).Over the years, I have grown from being an outreach intern, a programme manager to a developer. I have also had the pleasure of hosting and being part of various events, including the UN Datathon (at the United Nations, Geneva) and Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathons (which I conceptualised). I also got the chance of leading development of a Python tool called [`docanalysis`](https://github.com/petermr/docanalysis); through which I learnt the philosophies and best practices of open source, which I practice till date.

I am extremely grateful to Peter Murray-Rust for being the best mentor :)
